# GraphQL API Development

This project involves developing a GraphQL API for a complex data model. GraphQL is a query language for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need, making it well-suited for complex data structures. The API will implement queries, mutations, and subscriptions to enable data retrieval, manipulation, and real-time updates. Additionally, the project includes optimizing the API for performance and security to ensure efficient and secure data access.

## Features

- __GraphQL API__: Develop a GraphQL API to expose data and operations on a complex data model.
- __Queries__: Implement queries to retrieve data from the API.
- __Mutations__: Implement mutations to modify data in the API.
- __Subscriptions__: Implement subscriptions to enable real-time updates for clients.
- __Performance Optimization__: Optimize the API for efficient data retrieval and processing.
- __Security__: Implement security measures to protect the API against common vulnerabilities.

<br/>

## Utility Functions

- __GraphQL Schema Definition__: Define the GraphQL schema to describe the types and operations supported by the API.
- __Resolver Functions__: Write resolver functions to handle queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
- __Performance Optimization Techniques__: Implement techniques such as batching, caching, and pagination to improve API performance.
- __Security Measures Implementation__: Implement authentication, authorization, and input validation to enhance API security.

## Implementation

- __GraphQL Schema Definition__: Define the GraphQL schema to describe the types and operations supported by the API.
- __Resolver Functions Development__: Write resolver functions to handle queries, mutations, and subscriptions, fetching data from appropriate data sources.
- __Performance Optimization__: Implement performance optimization techniques such as batching, caching, and pagination to improve API performance.
- __Security Implementation__: Implement authentication, authorization, and input validation to enhance API security and protect against common vulnerabilities.

<br/>

## Testing

- __Unit Testing__: Test individual resolver functions to ensure they behave as expected.
- __Integration Testing__: Test the integration between different parts of the API, including queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
- __Performance Testing__: Test the API's performance under various loads to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.
- __Security Testing__: Test the API for common security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks and unauthorized access attempts.

<br/>

## Example Scenarios

- __Query Execution__: Execute GraphQL queries to retrieve data from the API and verify the returned results.
- __Mutation Execution__: Execute GraphQL mutations to modify data in the API and verify the changes.
- __Subscription Handling__: Subscribe to real-time updates using GraphQL subscriptions and verify that updates are received.
- __Performance Analysis__: Analyze API performance metrics under different loads and optimize performance where necessary.
- __Security Assessment__: Perform security testing to identify and address any vulnerabilities in the API.
